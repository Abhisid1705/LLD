Solid principles is a design methodology which helps us in creating extensible,scalable and modular
architecture

S->Single Responsibility Principle -Each software module should have single responsibility
O->Open closed principle - Class is open for extension closed for modification
L->liskov substitution principle -A super class can always be substituted by derived class without affecting
the functionality
I->Interface segregation Principle -> Client can not be forced to depend on interface that it does not require
D->Dependency inversion principle ->Higher level module should not depend on low level module instead both should depend on
abstractions
